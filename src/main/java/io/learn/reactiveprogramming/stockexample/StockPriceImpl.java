/**
 * This class demonstrates a practical application of reactive programming
 * in the context of a stock price monitoring system.
 *
 * Use Case: Real-time Stock Price Monitoring
 * - Continuously receive and process stock price updates from an external service.
 * - Handle the stream of updates reactively, allowing for real-time processing and analysis.
 * - Demonstrate how reactive programming can be used in financial data systems.

     * 1. Creating a client to connect to an external stock price service.
     * 2. Setting up a subscriber to handle incoming stock price updates.
     * 3. Initiating the subscription to start receiving updates.
     * 4. Running the system for a fixed duration to simulate real-time monitoring.

/**
 * Additional insights from the stockexample folder:
 *
 * 1. ExternalServiceClient (assumed to be in the client package):
 *    - Likely implements the connection to an external stock price service.
 *    - The getStockPriceChanges() method probably returns a Flux or Observable
 *      of stock price updates.
 *
 * 2. StockPriceObserver (in the same package):
 *    - Implements the Subscriber interface to handle stock price updates.
 *    - Likely includes methods to process and possibly display or store the updates.
 *
 * 3. AbstractHttpClient (in the common package):
 *    - Provides a base implementation for HTTP clients used in the application.
 *    - The createDefaultHttpClient() method creates a standard configuration for HTTP connections.
 *
 * Key aspects of this reactive stock price monitoring system:
 *
 * - Asynchronous Data Handling: The system can handle a continuous stream of stock price
 *   updates without blocking, allowing for efficient processing of real-time data.
 *
 * - Separation of Concerns: The ExternalServiceClient handles data retrieval,
 *   while StockPriceObserver focuses on processing the received data.
 *
 * - Scalability: This reactive approach can easily handle varying rates of incoming
 *   data, making it suitable for high-frequency trading scenarios or periods of
 *   high market volatility.
 *
 * - Extensibility: Additional processing steps (like filtering, transforming, or
 *   aggregating stock data) can be easily added to the reactive stream.
 *
 * - Resource Management: The reactive nature ensures efficient use of system resources,
 *   as it only processes data when it's available and can handle backpressure if the
 *   system becomes overwhelmed.
 *
 * This example showcases how reactive programming can be applied to real-world
 * financial systems, providing a robust and efficient way to handle real-time
 * data streams in a stock market context.
